# Java Object-Oriented Programming – Part 1

This repository contains my handwritten handnotes on **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Part 1**, prepared during my university studies. The notes are organized carefully to cover almost all fundamental Java OOP concepts in a clear and beginner-friendly way.

## Contents
This repository includes detailed explanations and examples of the following topics:

- Introduction to Programming and Java
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Advantages of OOP over Procedural Programming
- Features of OOP:
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- Classes and Objects
- Data members and member functions
- Methods and Constructors
- Types of constructors
- Instance variables, local variables, and static variables
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- Use of `this` keyword
- Static keyword and static members
- Method overloading
- Basic understanding of packages
- Basic Java syntax related to OOP
- Important theoretical explanations
- Handwritten notes with simple and clear examples

## Purpose
The purpose of sharing these notes is to help:
- Beginners learning Java
- University students studying Object-Oriented Programming
- Students preparing for exams and concept revision

These notes focus more on **conceptual understanding** rather than advanced coding.

## How to Use
- Read the notes topic-wise
- Understand the concepts before writing code
- Use the notes for quick revision before exams
